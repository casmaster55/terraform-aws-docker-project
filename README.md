  Deploying a Dynamic Website on AWS with Terraform, Docker, and AWS ECR

  Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to deploy a dynamic web application on AWS using Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). The deployment includes S3 for storage, ECS for containerized application hosting, ECR for container images, and Route 53 for DNS management**.

The project also includes a `rentzone.env` file that is used for environment variable configuration during the Docker build process before pushing the container to AWS ECR.

 Technologies Used
- **Terraform** (Infrastructure as Code)
- **Amazon S3** (Static file storage)
- **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)** (Containerized app deployment)
- **AWS Fargate** (Serverless container execution)
- **Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)** (Container image storage)
- **Amazon Route 53** (DNS management)
- **Docker** (Containerization)
- **AWS IAM** (Access management)

 Project Setup & Deployment Steps

Clone the Repository
  sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deploy-dynamic-website-aws-terraform.git
cd deploy-dynamic-website-aws-terraform


2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the following installed:

Terraform ((https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install))
AWS CLI ((https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html))
Docker ((https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))
Verify installation:

terraform -version
aws --version
docker --version


3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure AWS Credentials
Set up your AWS CLI:

aws configure

You'll need to provide:

AWS Access Key ID
AWS Secret Access Key
Region (us-east-1)


4Ô∏è‚É£ Create the rentzone.env File
The rentzone.env file contains environment variables required for the Docker container:

# rentzone.env
APP_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@host:3306/dbname
SECRET_KEY=mysecretkey
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
Make sure to update the values according to your setup.


5Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize Terraform & Deploy Infrastructure

Run the following Terraform commands:
Initialize Terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve

This will create: ‚úÖ S3 bucket for static files
‚úÖ ECR repository to store Docker images
‚úÖ ECS cluster with Fargate services
‚úÖ Route 53 domain mapping


6Ô∏è‚É£ Build & Push the Docker Image to AWS ECR
Once Terraform sets up the AWS ECR repository, build and push the Docker image.

Step 1: Authenticate Docker with AWS ECR

Step 2: Build the Docker Image Using rentzone.env
Step 3: Tag the Image
Step 4: Push the Image to ECR


7Ô∏è‚É£ Upload the rentzone.env File to S3 (Optional)
If your ECS service needs access to the rentzone.env file, upload it to Amazon S3:
Then, your ECS task can retrieve it dynamically.




8Ô∏è‚É£ Access the Deployed Application
Once deployment is complete, Terraform will output a public URL (from Route 53 or Load Balancer).

‚ïµ
ChatGPT said:
The error indicates that your Terraform Route 53 data source (aws_route53_zone) query is returning multiple hosted zones, and Terraform doesn‚Äôt know which one to use. To fix this, you need to apply additional constraints to filter for a single hosted zone.

‚úÖ Solution Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Check Your Existing Hosted Zones
Run the following AWS CLI command to check the hosted zones in your AWS account:

sh
Copy
Edit
aws route53 list-hosted-zones
This will return a list of hosted zones. Look for the zone name or hosted zone ID.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Modify Terraform Code to Select the Correct Zone
You need to update your Terraform configuration to be more specific.

Option 1: Use the Hosted Zone ID (Recommended)
Modify acm.tf (or where your aws_route53_zone data block is located) by specifying the hosted zone ID directly:

hcl
Copy
Edit
data "aws_route53_zone" "route53_zone" {
  zone_id = "Z123456ABCDEFG"  # Replace with your actual hosted zone ID
}
Option 2: Filter by Domain Name
If you don‚Äôt want to hardcode the hosted zone ID, you can filter by domain name:

hcl
Copy
Edit
data "aws_route53_zone" "route53_zone" {
  name = "example.com"  # Replace with your actual domain name
}
Option 3: Use Private/Public Zone Filter
If you have both public and private hosted zones, specify which one you want:

hcl
Copy
Edit
data "aws_route53_zone" "route53_zone" {
  name   = "example.com"  # Replace with your actual domain
  private_zone = false  # Set to true if you are using a private zone
}
3Ô∏è‚É£ Apply Changes
After updating your Terraform configuration, run:

sh
Copy
Edit
terraform plan
If everything looks correct, apply the changes:

sh
Copy
Edit
terraform apply -auto-approve
üéØ Summary
Your error occurs because multiple hosted zones match your query. To resolve it:

Use the Hosted Zone ID if you know it (zone_id).
Filter by Domain Name (name = "example.com").
Specify Private or Public Zone (private_zone = true/false).
Try these solutions and let me know if you still face issues! üöÄ

            },
-- More  --
ChatGPT said:
Since you have a single hosted zone with ID: Z06033821NYXLMOAUVJ17 and domain djomodevops.com., you should modify your Terraform configuration to explicitly reference this hosted zone.

‚úÖ Fix: Update Your acm.tf File
Modify your acm.tf file to use the hosted zone ID directly:

hcl
Copy
Edit
data "aws_route53_zone" "route53_zone" {
  zone_id = "Z06033821NYXLMOAUVJ17"
}
OR, if you prefer to use the domain name, modify it like this:

hcl
Copy
Edit
data "aws_route53_zone" "route53_zone" {
  name         = "djomodevops.com."
  private_zone = false
}
üìå Next Steps
Run Terraform Plan to check if it resolves the issue:
sh
Copy
Edit
terraform plan
If no errors, apply the changes:
sh
Copy
Edit
terraform apply -auto-approve
Verify the deployment by checking the Terraform output.
This should resolve the "multiple Route 53 Hosted Zones matched" error. Let me know if you need further debugging! üöÄ

ChatGPT said:
The issue here is that you have two duplicate data "aws_route53_zone" "route53_zone" blocks in your acm.tf file. Terraform does not allow multiple declarations of the same data block, which is why it is returning multiple matches.

üîß Solution: Remove the Duplicate data.aws_route53_zone Block
You currently have two identical blocks in your Terraform file:

hcl
Copy
Edit
data "aws_route53_zone" "route53_zone" {
  name         = "djomodevops.com."
  private_zone = false
}
To fix this, keep only one and remove the duplicate. Your updated acm.tf file should look like this:

hcl
Copy
Edit
# Get details about a Route 53 hosted zone
data "aws_route53_zone" "route53_zone" {
  name         = "djomodevops.com."
  private_zone = false
}

# Request public certificates from the Amazon Certificate Manager.
resource "aws_acm_certificate" "acm_certificate" {
  domain_name               = var.domain_name
  subject_alternative_names = [var.alternative_names] 
  validation_method         = "DNS"

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

# Create a record set in Route 53 for domain validation
resource "aws_route53_record" "route53_record" {
  for_each = {
    for dvo in aws_acm_certificate.acm_certificate.domain_validation_options : dvo.domain_name => {
      name   = dvo.resource_record_name
      record = dvo.resource_record_value
      type   = dvo.resource_record_type
    }
  }

  allow_overwrite = true
  name            = each.value.name
  records         = [each.value.record]
  ttl             = 60
  type            = each.value.type
  zone_id         = data.aws_route53_zone.route53_zone.zone_id
}

# Validate ACM certificates
resource "aws_acm_certificate_validation" "acm_certificate_validation" {
  certificate_arn         = aws_acm_certificate.acm_certificate.arn
  validation_record_fqdns = [for record in aws_route53_record.route53_record : record.fqdn]
}
üõ† Next Steps
Save the file after removing the duplicate block.
Re-run Terraform Plan:
sh
Copy
Edit
terraform plan
If everything looks good, apply the changes:
sh
Copy
Edit
terraform apply -auto-approve
This should resolve the "multiple Route 53 Hosted Zones matched" error. Let me know if you still face any issues! üöÄ

ChatGPT said:
Your Terraform configuration is still finding multiple hosted zones matching your query. This means there might be duplicate hosted zones in your AWS account or that AWS is returning results that include both public and private hosted zones.

‚úÖ Solution: Use Hosted Zone ID Instead of Name
Since you have a single hosted zone ID (Z06033821NYXLMOAUVJ17), modify your acm.tf file to use this ID explicitly.

üîπ Update acm.tf with Hosted Zone ID
Replace your data.aws_route53_zone block with:

h
Copy
Edit
data "aws_route53_zone" "route53_zone" {
  zone_id = "Z06033821NYXLMOAUVJ17"  # Replace with your actual Hosted Zone ID
}
üîç Alternative Fix: Ensure Only One Public Zone is Selected
If you want to filter by name, add private_zone = false to ensure it selects the public hosted zone only:

hcl
Copy
Edit
data "aws_route53_zone" "route53_zone" {
  name         = "djomodevops.com."
  private_zone = false
}
üìå Next Steps
Run Terraform Plan to check for errors:
sh
Copy
Edit
terraform plan
If successful, apply the changes:
sh
Copy
Edit
terraform apply -auto-approve
Verify the Route 53 setup in AWS:
Go to AWS Route 53 ‚Üí Hosted Zones.
Ensure you only have one hosted zone for djomodevops.com.
üöÄ Summary
‚úÖ Best Fix: Use zone_id = "Z06033821NYXLMOAUVJ17" in Terraform.
üîç Alternative: Use name = "djomodevops.com." private_zone = false to ensure it selects the public zone.
üõ† Check for duplicates in Route 53.

ChatGPT said:
The error you're facing is due to two separate issues:

Issue 1: Invalid S3 Bucket Name
The bucket name rentzone-casmaster55-ecs-=env-file-bucket contains an invalid character (=). S3 bucket names must follow these rules:

Only lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), hyphens (-), and periods (.) are allowed.
No equal signs (=) or special characters.
Bucket names must be between 3 and 63 characters long.
They cannot begin or end with a hyphen (-).
‚úÖ Solution: Rename the Bucket in s3.tf
Modify your s3.tf file and update the bucket name:

h
Copy
Edit
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "env_file_bucket" {
  bucket = "rentzone-casmaster55-ecs-env-file-bucket"  # Removed '='
}
Then re-run:

sh
Copy
Edit
terraform apply -auto-approve
Issue 2: Missing File in Download Directory
Since the S3 download process failed because the file was deleted, you have a few alternatives to fix this:

‚úÖ Solution 1: Re-upload the File Manually
If you have a backup of the missing file, you can manually upload it back to S3 using the AWS CLI:

sh
Copy
Edit
aws s3 cp /path/to/local/file s3://rentzone-casmaster55-ecs-env-file-bucket/
Replace /path/to/local/file with the actual path of the file.

‚úÖ Solution 2: Recreate and Upload the File
If the file was generated as part of your Terraform setup or another script, you may need to regenerate it and re-upload it to S3.

For example, if it's an .env file, you can recreate it:

sh
Copy
Edit
echo "ENV_VAR=your_value" > .env
aws s3 cp .env s3://rentzone-casmaster55-ecs-env-file-bucket/
‚úÖ Solution 3: Delete and Recreate the Bucket
If the bucket creation failed because of the error, delete the existing bucket (if any) and re-run Terraform:

sh
Copy
Edit
aws s3 rb s3://rentzone-casmaster55-ecs-=env-file-bucket --force
Then apply your Terraform changes again:

sh
Copy
Edit
terraform apply -auto-approve
üéØ Summary
Fix the invalid bucket name by removing the = in your Terraform configuration.
Re-upload the missing file manually or regenerate it.
If necessary, delete and recreate the S3 bucket.
Try this and let me know if you run into any more issues! üöÄ

üö® Issue: Invalid S3 Bucket Name
Your bucket name rentzone-casmaster55-ecs-=env-file-bucket is invalid due to the = character. AWS does not allow special characters like = in S3 bucket names, and this is why you cannot delete or manage the bucket using the AWS CLI.

‚úÖ Solution: Force Remove the Corrupted S3 Bucket
Since the bucket name is invalid, AWS does not recognize it properly, and you cannot delete it using standard commands. Here are alternative ways to fix it:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Try Deleting via the AWS Console
If the bucket appears in your AWS Console:

Go to AWS Management Console ‚Üí S3.
Find the bucket in the list (it might be partially broken or hidden).
Delete it manually.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Check for the Bucket Using AWS CLI (if visible)
List all available S3 buckets:

sh
Copy
Edit
aws s3 ls
If the bucket is listed, try deleting it without the invalid character:

sh
Copy
Edit
aws s3 rb s3://rentzone-casmaster55-ecs-env-file-bucket --force
3Ô∏è‚É£ Use AWS SDK (Python) to Delete the Bucket
If the AWS CLI still doesn‚Äôt work, you can force the deletion using Python and Boto3:

Install Boto3 (if not installed):

sh
Copy
Edit
pip install boto3
Run the script below (make sure to replace the bucket name with the exact invalid name):

python
Copy
Edit
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client("s3")

bucket_name = "rentzone-casmaster55-ecs-=env-file-bucket"  # Replace with the exact name

try:
    # List and delete all objects in the bucket
    objects = s3.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name)
    if "Contents" in objects:
        s3.delete_objects(
            Bucket=bucket_name,
            Delete={"Objects": [{"Key": obj["Key"]} for obj in objects["Contents"]]},
        )
        print("All objects deleted from the bucket.")

    # Delete the bucket itself
    s3.delete_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)
    print(f"Bucket '{bucket_name}' deleted successfully.")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
4Ô∏è‚É£ Contact AWS Support
If none of the above methods work, and you cannot manually delete the bucket from the AWS Console, you may need to contact AWS Support. They can force-remove the corrupted bucket for you.

üéØ Final Steps
Manually delete the bucket from AWS Console (if possible).
If CLI works, use:
sh
Copy
Edit
aws s3 rb s3://rentzone-casmaster55-ecs-env-file-bucket --force
Use Python (Boto3) to force delete the bucket if CLI doesn‚Äôt work.
Contact AWS Support if nothing else works.
Try these methods and let me know if you need more help! üöÄ

üö® Issue: Missing File (rerentzone.env)
Your Terraform script is trying to upload a file rerentzone.env to Amazon S3, but the file does not exist in your local directory. That‚Äôs why you're getting:

bash
Copy
Edit
Error: opening S3 object source (./rerentzone.env): open ./rerentzone.env: The system cannot find the file specified.
‚úÖ Solutions to Fix the Issue
1Ô∏è‚É£ Manually Create the Missing File
Since Terraform expects rerentzone.env, you can manually create the file:

sh
Copy
Edit
echo "ENV_VAR=your_value" > rerentzone.env
or use a text editor:

Linux/macOS: nano rerentzone.env
Windows: Use Notepad or VS Code to create rerentzone.env in the project folder.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Modify Terraform to Ignore the Missing File
If you don‚Äôt want to create the file manually and need Terraform to proceed without an error, modify s3.tf:

Option 1: Use a Default File in Terraform
Update s3.tf to use a default file when the rerentzone.env is missing:

h
Copy
Edit
resource "aws_s3_object" "upload_env_file" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.env_file_bucket.id
  key    = "rerentzone.env"
  source = fileexists("./rerentzone.env") ? "./rerentzone.env" : "./default.env"
  acl    = "private"
}
Then, create a default.env file:

sh
Copy
Edit
echo "DEFAULT_VAR=default_value" > default.env
Option 2: Skip Uploading the File if Not Found
Modify s3.tf to conditionally skip the upload if the file is missing:

hcl
Copy
Edit
resource "aws_s3_object" "upload_env_file" {
  count  = fileexists("./rerentzone.env") ? 1 : 0
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.env_file_bucket.id
  key    = "rerentzone.env"
  source = "./rerentzone.env"
  acl    = "private"
}
3Ô∏è‚É£ Pull the Missing File from Another Location
If the rerentzone.env file was deleted or misplaced, try recovering it:

Check your backups (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.).
Look in your Git history:
sh
Copy
Edit
git log --name-status | grep rerentzone.env
Download from an existing S3 bucket (if previously uploaded):
sh
Copy
Edit
aws s3 cp s3://your-bucket-name/rerentzone.env ./
üéØ Final Steps
Manually create rerentzone.env (best option).
Modify Terraform to handle missing files (default.env or count method).
Recover the file from S3, Git, or backups.
Try this and let me know if you need more help! üöÄ

# üåç Deploying a Dynamic Website on AWS with Terraform

## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to deploy a **dynamic web application** on **AWS** using **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). The deployment is fully automated and includes **S3 for storage, ECS for containerized application hosting, ECR for container images, and Route 53 for DNS management**.

By leveraging **Terraform**, the entire AWS infrastructure is **scalable, repeatable, and easy to manage**.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Technologies Used
- **Terraform** (Infrastructure as Code)
- **Amazon S3** (Static file storage)
- **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)** (Containerized app deployment)
- **AWS Fargate** (Serverless container execution)
- **Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)** (Container image storage)
- **Amazon Route 53** (DNS management)
- **Docker** (Containerization)
- **AWS IAM** (Access management)

---

## üöÄ Project Setup & Deployment Steps

‚úÖ ECR repository to store Docker images
‚úÖ ECS cluster with Fargate services
‚úÖ Route 53 domain mapping

5Ô∏è‚É£ Build & Push the Docker Image
If your app requires a Docker container, build and push it to Amazon ECR:

Authenticate Docker to AWS ECR

sh
Copy
Edit
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Build the Docker Image

sh
Copy
Edit
docker build -t my-dynamic-app .
Tag the Image

sh
Copy
Edit
docker tag my-dynamic-app:latest <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-dynamic-app
Push the Image to ECR

sh
Copy
Edit
docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-dynamic-app
6Ô∏è‚É£ Access the Deployed Application
Once deployment is complete, Terraform will output a public URL (from Route 53 or Load Balancer).

Run:

sh
Copy
Edit
terraform output
Visit the displayed URL in your browser.

Edit
terraform destroy -auto-approve
üéØ Key Takeaways
Infrastructure as Code: Automate deployments with Terraform.
Scalability: Leverage ECS (Fargate) for containers and S3 for static content.
AWS Best Practices: Use ECR for container storage, Route 53 for domain management, and IAM for secure permissions.
üìå Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
‚úÖ Automate deployments using GitHub Actions (CI/CD).
‚úÖ Add CloudFront for better performance & security.
‚úÖ Enable SSL (HTTPS) with AWS Certificate Manager.
‚úÖ Set up CloudWatch for monitoring & logging.
